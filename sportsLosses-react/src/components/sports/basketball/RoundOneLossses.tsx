        With 5 appearances in the NCAA Division 1 Basketball Tournament, we have
        managed to lose an outstanding 4 of our 5 appearances. Granted we were
        often pitted against much higher ranked teams, but an 80% loss rate is
        still impressive! The unfortunate scores are listed below.
