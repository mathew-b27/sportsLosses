      <p>
        With 5 appearances in the NCAA Division 1 Basketball Tournament, we have
        managed to lose an outstanding 4 of our 5 appearances. Granted we were
        often pitted against much higher ranked teams, but an 80% loss rate is
        still impressive! The unfortunate scores are listed below.
      </p>
      <h2>Purdue: 98 -- UCF: 67</h2>
      <h2>Massachusetts: 92 -- UCF: 70</h2>
      <h2>Pittsburgh: 53 -- UCF: 44</h2>
      <h2>Connecticut: 77 -- UCF: 71</h2>
